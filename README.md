# Resources

A place to collect links to resources related to geomagnetism and heliophysics. There's a lot of stuff out there hard to discover and keep track of!

A simple CSV file is easy to add to and allows categorisation via tags/keywords.

The viewer should make it available at https://magneticearth.github.io/resources/resources.html
